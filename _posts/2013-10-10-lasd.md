Collaborator [James Molyneux](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~james.molyneux/) and I evaluated reams of donation data from a campaign by LA County Undersheriff Paul Tanaka. Tanaka has served several terms as mayor of nearby Gardenia and had been accused of prioritizing promotions of those within the Sheriff's Department who had donated to his outside campaigns. We [determined](/projects/files/LASD.pdf) that certain types of promotions did appear to coincide with these donations.
