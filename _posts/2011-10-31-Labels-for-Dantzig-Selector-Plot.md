I was playing around after class today with the code we were given for the Dantzig Selector, [DS.R](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~hqxu/stat201A/R/DS.R).  It was frustrating to use because you had to guess at which of the lines was which factor.

I altered it a bit, so now it prints out labels at the beginning and at the end of each line, hopefully they won't overlap too much.  I also tried adding a color-coded legend, but it only fits terms up to D:G or so before it runs off the page. If you do want to use it, you can just uncomment that part of the dantzig.delta method.
