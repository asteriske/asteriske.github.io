title: LA Mayoral Campaign Donor Analysis 
published: false
---

During the 2013 LA Mayoral race I did a one-off project for then-councilman Eric Garcetti's campaign in which I was asked to find ways to maximize donations during the crucial home stretch. I identified trends in individual donor patterns, targeted ideal asking amounts for future outreach and evaluated some unconventional factors for identifying prime donors. I typed up the salient details in a little [report for the campaign staff](/projects/files/Garcetti.pdf).

UPDATE - He won!
